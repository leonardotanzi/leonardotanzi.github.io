I am a Ph.D. Student at the Polytechnic University of Turin, Italy, currently living in Paris and working as a Ph.D. visiting student at UTC Sorbonne Alliance Université under the supervision of Prof. [Yves Grandvalet](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZX9LE3QAAAAJ&hl=en).

I've received a Master’s Degree in Computer Engineering, Graphic and Multimedia Curricula, in 2019, after a six-month thesis research experience at KTH University of Stockholm, Department of Technology and Health. 

My current research focuses on human-machine methodologies for smart support during complex interventions, using Deep Learning and Augmented Reality for 3D assistance, with a focus on medical application for computer-assisted surgery during pre-operative and intra-operative procedures. I have collaborated with several research groups in the medical field, such as the CTO of Turin's orthopedic team, the San Luigi Hospital's urology team, and the Molinette's maxillofacial team. 

I have lived in three countries (Italy, Sweden and France) and speak English, French and Italian.
