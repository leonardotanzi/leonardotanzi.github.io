I am a Ph.D. Student at the Polytechnic University of Turin, Italy, currently living in Paris and working as a Ph.D. visiting student at UTC Sorbonne Alliance Université under the supervision of Prof. [Yves Grandvalet](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZX9LE3QAAAAJ&hl=en).

I've received a Master’s Degree in Computer Engineering, Graphic and Multimedia Curricula, in 2019, after a six-month thesis research experience at KTH University of Stockholm, Department of Technology and Health. 

My current research focuses on human-machine methodologies for smart support during complex interventions, using Deep Learning and Computer Vision for 3D assistance, with a focus on medical application for computer-assisted surgery during pre-operative and intra-operative procedures. I have collaborated with several research groups in the medical field, such as the CTO of Turin's orthopedic team, the San Luigi Hospital's urology team, and the Molinette's maxillofacial team. 

I have lived in three countries (Italy, Sweden and France) and speak English, French and Italian.

## AI Technical Writer
I love to write and discuss stuff related to AI, in my [Medium](https://medium.com/@leonardo.tanzi), I describe and explain different paper that I find exciting for the research community. In addition, I'm collaborating with [MarkTechPost](https://www.marktechpost.com/), a California-based Artificial Intelligence news platform which focuses on spreading AI Awareness across the globe, reaching more than 1M views per month. 

## Teaching
I had the opportunity to teach a part of the course 3D Biometric Application, a Master's Course at Polytechnic University of Turin, a course that aims to provide an understanding of 3D tools and methods for acquiring, modeling, visualizing, and managing data from human anatomy to develop intelligent applications in different application fields. My lessons were focused on an Introduction to Machine Learning and Deep Learning. You can find the slides that I prepared and used [here](.\MLDL_Tanzi.pdf).
