# Computer Assisted Maxillofacial Surgery

Implementation of a Deep Learning based application to assist specialists in surgery pre-planning. As a first step, we are implementing an algorithm that could classify a person into three classes: Mandibular Prognathism, Mandibular Progenism, and Mandibular Laterodeviation. The particularity of this work is that it is trained of different view of the patient (frontal, lateral, ¾) but should return a prediction given just one of the three views, in order to be used in everyday clinical routine. This work is being carried out in collaboration with the Maxillofacial unity of the Molinette Hospital, in Turin – Italy.


# Blood Accumulation

After defining a concept of the Intelligent Operating Room in a literature review paper, we start this idea in implementing an event predictor which can detect anomalies together with giving information to the surgeon. For example, we started our work focusing on the blood accumulation problem. We trained a CNN-LSTM to predict the moment when there is too much blood and it should require an intervention. In parallel, the same algorithm is also trained for segmentation and localization of different objects. This work was done in collaboration with
