Implementation of a Deep Learning based application to segment the endoscopic video stream during real-time prostatectomy. In the fifth phase of this procedure, the biopsy, it is crucial to locale the area where the tumor was before the removal of the prostate. Using the catheter as an anchor, the 3D model is attached to the 2D stream of the Da Vinci robot to help the surgeon locate the correct area. This work is being carried out and tested during in-vivo surgery in collaboration with the Urology unity of the San Luigi Hospital, in Orbassano (To) â€“ Italy.}
